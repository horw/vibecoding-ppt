# Real-World Experience: "I've Been Doing It for Two Years"

## Dev.to Article by Vorniches
- Started using AI for coding two years ago
- Uses AI to handle ~90% of the code writing
- Created tools to improve the workflow:
  - **Prototype**: Docker-based Django quick-start
  - **snap2txt**: Tool that converts an entire project into a single text file for AI context

> "From the first day I saw modern neural nets in action, I started using them â€“ not to flood the web with AI-baked memes, but for real work."
