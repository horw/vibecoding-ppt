- Files should not be too large; after 500 lines, it's going crazy.
- You can use ChatGPT to help creating specific prompts; for example, https://firebase.studio/ has some prompts to use before starting work.
- You can also instruct the agent to save completed tasks to a file, such as tasks.md; it can read it in the future.
- Use it for the most common tasks: CRUD, Bootstrap, etc. It is not good with very rare tasks.
- If you already know how to complete the task, then do it yourself.
- Use frameworks; they contain more context, like Django, Flask, etc.
