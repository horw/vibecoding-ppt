# How Vibe Coding Works

- **Voice-first interaction** - "I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper"
- **Natural language commands** - "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half"
- **Trust the AI** - "I 'Accept All' always, I don't read the diffs anymore"
- **Effortless debugging** - "When I get error messages I just copy paste them in"
- **Low-friction workflow** - "I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff"
