# Task 3: Building a Simple Game with AI

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">

## The Challenge:
Create a simple browser-based game (like Flappy Bird or Doodle Jump) without writing all the code yourself.

## Why This Demonstrates Vibe Coding:
- Games typically require complex logic and physics
- Traditional development would take days or weeks
- With vibe coding, you can have a working prototype in minutes
- Focus on game mechanics, not implementation details

## Vibe Coding Workflow:
1. **Describe the game concept**: "Create a Flappy Bird clone where..."
2. **Request game mechanics**: "The character should jump when clicked..."
3. **Ask for visual changes**: "Make the background a night sky with stars"
4. **Iterate quickly**: "Add a score counter in the top right"
