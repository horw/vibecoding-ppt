# Task 1: Vibe Coding a Professional CV

<div class="flex">
<div class="flex-1 pr-4">

## The Task:
Using Cursor or any AI coding assistant, create a stylish CV/resume without writing HTML/CSS manually.

## Vibe Coding Approach:
1. Describe your desired layout and style
2. Let AI generate the complete HTML/CSS
3. Provide simple feedback like "make the font larger" or "add more space between sections"
4. Focus on content, not implementation

job at a skate shop. Create a professional CV
with my fictional experience:
- 3 years working at local skate events
- Familiar with top skateboarding brands
- Basic knowledge of skateboard maintenance

Make it visually appealing with a modern layout."

Notes: This exercise demonstrates how vibe coding lets you create polished visual outputs
without needing to know detailed HTML/CSS. Observe how minor adjustments can be made through
natural language rather than code edits.
