# Benefits & Considerations

## Benefits
- **Rapid development** - ideal for prototyping and MVPs
- **Reduced cognitive load** - focus on features, not implementation
- **Accessibility** - coding becomes available to non-programmers

## Considerations
- "The code grows beyond my usual comprehension"
- "Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it"
- Better for "throwaway weekend projects" than production systems
